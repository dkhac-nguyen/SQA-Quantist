    #  The try block lets we test a block of code for errors.
    #  The except block lets we handle the error.
    #  The else block lets we execute code when there is no error.
    #  The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

    #  The try block will generate an exception if something goes wrong
    #  Many Exceptions
    #  We can define as many exception blocks as we want, e.g. 
    #      if one wants to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:

    try:
      print("Hello")
    except:
      print("Something went wrong")
    else:     # We can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:
      print("Nothing went wrong")

    try:
      print(x)
    except:
      print("Something went wrong")
    finally:  # The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.
